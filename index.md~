##Announcements

**ddcutil** release 0.9.9 contains a couple changes of general interest: 

- A new command line option, ***--less-sleep*** eliminates many of the delays between the time that **ddcutil** receives a DDC response from a display
and sends the next request, improving performance.
<!-- - User Defined Features are now supported. -->
- Support for AMD's old proprietary **fglrx** driver has been dropped.

The **libddcutil** shared libray has minor changes.  For details, see [Shared Library Changes for Release 0.9.9](c_api_99.md).

**ddcui** release 0.1.1 adds additional features and has numerous changes in the "fit and finish" category.  In particular:

- Command line options for starting ***ddcui***, corresponding to settings in the ***Option*** dialogs, and (if multiple monitors) 
  the initlal monitor selected.
- The ***Feature Selection Dialog***, along with command line option ***--custom-feature-set***, 
enable the user to specify the VCP features to be shown.
- Better handling of error conditions
- Better **Help** text

For general information about the graphical user interface, see [ddcui](ddcui_main.md).

For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see [Release Notes](release_notes.md).
Prior announcements can be found [here](prior_announcements.md).

Lastly, this website has been extensively revised to reflect the current state of **ddcutil** and **ddcui**.

##Introduction

**ddcutil** is a Linux program for managing monitor settings, such as brightness, color levels, and input source.
Generally speaking, any setting that can be changed by pressing buttons on the monitor can be modified by **ddcutil**.

**ddcutil** primarily uses DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface) to communicate with monitors implementing MCCS 
(Monitor Control Command Set) over I2C.  Normally, the video driver for the
monitor exposes the I2C channel as devices named /dev/i2c-n.  Alternatively, there is support for monitors (such as Eizo ColorEdge displays) that implement MCCS using a USB connection.  See [USB Connected Monitors](usb.md). 

A particular use case for **ddcutil**, and the one that inspired its development, is as part of color profile management. 
Monitor calibration is relative to the monitor color settings currently in effect, 
e.g. red gain.  ddcutil allows color related settings to be saved at the time 
a monitor is calibrated, and then restored when the calibration is applied.

Restrictions:  

- **ddcutil** does not support laptop displays, which are controlled using a special API, not I2C.   
- Generally speaking, **ddcutil** can be built in a virtual machine, but will not run in a VM.  This is
because the virtual video drivers do not implement I2C.  However, if the VM is connected to a separate
video card and is running a non-virtualized driver for the card in passthru mode, then **ddcutil** will work.  
- Nvidia's proprietary video driver may require special configuration.  See 
[Special Nvidia Driver Settings](nvidia.md).   
- Reading and writing ***Table*** type features is implemented but untested.  See [Table Features](table_features.md)  

**ddcutil** is released under the GNU Public License, V2 (GPLV2).

## ddcui

**ddcui** is a graphical user interface to **ddcutil**, built using Qt. It is currently beta level code. For further information, 
see [ddcui Overview](ddcui_main.md).

**ddcui** is released under the GNU Public License, V2 (GPLV2).
The source is hosted on [Github](http://www.github.com/rockowitz/ddcuui).

**ddcui** questions should also be directed the to the [ddcutil issue tracker](https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil/issues) on Github.
