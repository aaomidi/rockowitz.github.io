**ddcutil** release 1.1.0 contains the following changes of general interest:

- Configuration file **ddcutilrc**, located on the XDG config path (normally $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcutilrc)  is processed by both **ddcutil** and **libddcutil**. 
- Monitor capabilities strings are cached to improve performance of the **capabilities** command.
- Partial workarounds for problems in DRM video drivers (e.g. i915, AMDGPU) when monitors are connected to a docking station. The monitor may not be detected (because no EDID is reported), or the monitor may appear as two different /dev/i2c devices. 
- When probing /dev/i2c devices for monitors, **ddcutil** could put AMD Navi2 devices (e.g.  RX6000 series) into an inconsistent state. This is because the driver exposes an I2C devices for the SMU.  Display detection is modified to avoid probing these devices. 

The **libddcutil** shared library is unchanged. Its SONAME remains "libddcutil.so.4", and the package name is **libddcutil4**.

##Introduction

**ddcutil** is a Linux program for managing monitor settings, such as brightness, color levels, and input source.
Generally speaking, any setting that can be changed by pressing buttons on the monitor can be modified by **ddcutil**.

**ddcutil** primarily uses DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface) to communicate with monitors implementing MCCS 
(Monitor Control Command Set) over I2C.  Normally, the video driver for the
monitor exposes the I2C channel as devices named /dev/i2c-n.  Alternatively, there is support for monitors (such as Eizo ColorEdge displays) that implement MCCS using a USB connection.  See [USB Connected Monitors](usb.md). 

A particular use case for **ddcutil**, and the one that inspired its development, is as part of color profile management. 
Monitor calibration is relative to the monitor color settings currently in effect, 
e.g. red gain.  ddcutil allows color related settings to be saved at the time 
a monitor is calibrated, and then restored when the calibration is applied.

Restrictions:  

- **ddcutil** does not support laptop displays, which are controlled using a special API, not I2C.   
- Generally speaking, **ddcutil** can be built in a virtual machine, but will not run in a VM.  This is
because the virtual video drivers do not implement I2C.  However, if the VM is connected to a separate
video card and is running a non-virtualized driver for the card in passthru mode, then **ddcutil** will work.  
- Nvidia's proprietary video driver may require special configuration.  See 
[Special Nvidia Driver Settings](nvidia.md).   
- Reading and writing ***Table*** type features is implemented but untested.  See [Table Features](table_features.md)
