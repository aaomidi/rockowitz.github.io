So there is no hardware conflict, but you can create a software conflict if you enable i2c-0 in the kernel (dtparam=i2c_vc=on). There's a similar dtparam line to enable i2c-2 in the kernel, but doing so has the potential for some really bad side effects.


Note that the HDMI I2C is 5V, so connecting it to the standard 3.3V I2C interfaces will fry your Pi.
The HDMI I2C bus can be made accessible from Linux, so you don't need to link I2C busses. HOWEVER you really need to know what you're doing as it will stop the GPU and tvservice from being able to talk reliably to the display - forget EDID reading or hot plug.

Not necessarily, depends if the monitor is doing the pullup. even so it should be enough to add a 3.3V zener to the SDA/SCL lines. 3.3V levels should be enough for the monitor's I2C slaves to operate. 

Yes, but the GPU considers itself to be the sole user of the BSC2 peripheral. Poking the i2c from the ARM CPU (via linux driver) will likely work, but beware if the GPU tries to access the same peripheral then bad things will happen.
As long as you stay away from hotplugging HDMI, or tvservice commands (or anything likely to use tvservice) then the GPU is unlikely cause any traffic on BSC2.

From the commit that added i2c2_iknowhwhat...

https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/c6f0998f61b279d47e210b90d645643a6fe7932b

 i2c-bcm2708/BCM270X_DT: Add support for I2C2

The third I2C bus (I2C2) is normally reserved for HDMI use. Careless
use of this bus can break an attached display - use with caution.

It is recommended to disable accesses by VideoCore by setting
hdmi_ignore_edid=1 or hdmi_edid_file=1 in config.txt.

The interface is disabled by default - enable using the
i2c2_iknowwhatimdoing DT parameter.



Multiple users have reported building **ddcutil** for the Raspberry Pi and successfully running it.
One user reported that the following settings were required in file /boot/config.txt in order to enable the I2C buses:

~~~
dtparam=i2c0=on
dtparam=i2c1=on
dtparam=i2c_vc=on
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
dtparam=i2c2_iknowwhatimdoing=yes
~~~

My own experiences are limited to a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.  Running Raspbian (Release 2017-09-07), 
the following single line is required in /boot/config.txt:

~~~
dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
~~~

I could not find any other way to enable I2C for the HDMI connection, other than by using the vc4-kms-v3d driver.

- [Ubuntu bionic](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/ddcutil)


Note that the only prebuilt **ddcutil** packages for the Raspberry Pi are those in [Debian testing](https://packages.debian.org/testing/utils/ddcutil), which may be out of date.  Generally speaking, **ddcutil** must be built from source for the Pi.
