**ddcutil** release 0.9.8 contains two changes of general interest:  
- A new command line option, ***--sleep-multiplier***, adjusts the time **ddcutil** pauses between sending a request to the monitor
and reading from the monitor.   
- A fix for the bug that certain mice would lock up during display detection. 

The **libddcutil** shared library API has some minor extensions.  For details, see [Library Changes for Release 0.9.8](c_api_98.md).

Graphical user interface **ddcui** has reached beta status.  Release 0.1.0 contains numermous improvements in the handling of particular VCP feature codes and
the user interface generally.  Prebuilt packages now exist for many platforms. See [ddcui Overview](ddcui_main.md).

13 May 2018

Release 0.9.0 contains minor enhancements and a few very minor bug fixes.  However. the C API is extensively revised
(see [API Changes in Release 0.9.0](c_api_90.md)).

Two enhancements will be of interest to general users:  
- The **setvcp** command now allows new values for Continuous type features to be specified as relative values,
e.g. the following commands increase or decrease the value of the brightness feature by 5. 
~~~
$ ddcutil setvcp 10 + 5
$ ddcutil setvcp 10 - 5
~~~
Note that parsing requires that "+" and "-" be surrounded by spaces.

- Table type features are by default not included in most feature groups specified on **getvcp**, e.g. ***getvcp known***.
Features of type Table are rare.  The DDC/CI spec does not provide a clean way for **getvcp** to determine that a table 
feature does not exist.  As a result, **getvcp** typically has to exceed its retry count before giving up.
(Exclusion of table features does not occur if a feature is explicitly specified by its hex code, or for feature group ***TABLE***.)  
The ***--no-table*** (formerly ***--notable***) and ***-show-table*** options explicitly control this behavior.

For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see [Release Notes](release_notes.md).

20 January 2018

Release 0.8.6 contains a few minor externally visible enhancements and bug fixes, along with non-upwardly
compatible changes to the C API.  Most current users will see no need to upgrade.

For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see [Release Notes](release_notes.md).
Prior announcements can be found [here](prior_announcements.md).

**ddcutil** is now in the repositories for the upcoming Ubuntu 18.04 release and the openSUSE Tumbleweed rolling release. 

16 November 2017

Release 0.8.5 contains a large number of minor enhancements and bug fixes.  Users of **ddcutil** on 32 bit platforms and
those on the Raspberry Pi should upgrade.  

For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see [Release Notes](release_notes.md).
Prior announcements can be found [here](prior_announcements.md).

15 October 2017

Package **ddcutil** has been sponsored into Debian and is now included in [Debian Testing](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting).
It is on track to be part of the next Debian release, which means it should eventually appear in downstream distributions such as Ubuntu. 
Note that only package **ddcutil**, containing the command line version of **ddcutil**, is currently in the Debian repositories.
The shared library packages, including the C and Python APIs, are not yet part of Debian.

22 July 2017

USB connected monitors.

For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see [Release Notes](release_notes.md).
Prior annoucnements can be found [here](prior_announcements.md).

01 May 2017

Release 0.8.0 contains new features intended to address issues with particular monitors and user environments,
and to improve performance

The most significant changes visible to users are:  

- If there are multiple monitors and option **--async** is specified, initial monitor checks are performed in separate threads.
Users with multiple monitors should see significantly better startup time.  
- If a display is specified by its I2C bus number (option **--bus**) and option **--nodetect** is specified,
global display detection is skipped, improving performance.
- By default, **setvcp** and **loadvcp** now read the VCP value after it has been set, 
to confirm that the monitor has made the change requested.  
- Command **getvcp --terse** now reports VCP settings in a form that is easily machine readable.
- The C API has been extensively revised.  Many names have changed for consistency and clarity.  
(Apologies to those of you who have written applications.)

### OBS

29 April 2017

At some time in the recent past, the files for release 0.7.3 in the OpenSUSE Build Service were corrupted 
with files from the test system.  Symptoms of this corruption include

- Prefixing a VCP feature code number with "0x" causes a segfault, e.g. "ddcutil setvcp 0x10 50"  
- Command line option "--verify" is recognized

As of this morning, the production ddcutil project on OBS was restored to release 0.7.3.


### 0.7.3

05 March 2017

Release 0.7.3 is a maintenance release.  There is no need to install it unless you are experiencing problems.

This release introduces the following features:

- Command **ddcutil detect --verbose** shows additional information.
- Command **ddcutil environment --verbose** implements additional diagnostic tests.
- **configure** option ***--enable-drm*** controls whether DRM is used to enhance the diagnostics of command **ddcutil environment --verbose**.
If ***enable-drm=yes***, package libdrm-dev or libdrm-devel (depending on Linux distribution) must be installed to build **ddcutil**.
Setting ***--enable-drm=no*** affects only diagnostic output, not normal execution.

For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see [Release Notes](release_notes.md).
Prior annoucnements can be found [here](prior_announcements.md).


### 0.7.2

01 February 2017

Maintenance release.

- Fixes a critical bug in release 0.7.1 where insufficient privileges on a /dev/i2c-n device causes program termination.
- **ddcutil interrogate** always executes with ***--set-slave-address*** in effect
- Minor improvements to **ddcutil environment** and **ddcutil interrogate** output
- Minor improvements to **ddcutil detect --verbose**
- Add explanations for additional ***errno*** values

For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see [Release Notes](release_notes.md).
Prior annoucnements can be found [here](prior_announcements.md).


### 0.7.1

27 January 2017

Release 0.7.1 is a maintenance release.  There is no need to install it unless you are experiencing problems.

This release introduces the following features:

- Command option ***--force-slave-address*** causes **ddcutil** to attempt to take control of slave addresses
on the I2C bus even if they are in use by another driver.  This may aid in certain situations where monitors on 
an I2C bus are not properly detected. See [Instrumentation and Tuning](other_options.md#force_slave))

For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see [Release Notes](release_notes.md).
Prior annoucnements can be found [here](prior_announcements.md).

### 0.7.0

03 January 2017

Release 0.7 introduces the following features: 

- C API, exposed by shared library **libddcutil**.  See [API](api_main.md).  
- A new command line option ***--mfg***, allows for the 3 character manufaturer id found in the EDID to used as part of monitor selection.
- The monitor feature and capabilities portion of ***interrogate*** is also exposed by the  new ***probe*** command which explores the capabilities string and features found on a single monitor.

For details, see [Release Notes](release_notes.md).
Prior annoucnements can be found [here](prior_announcements.md).

openSUSE Build Service packaging of release 0.7.0 is complete.  Owing to Launchpad constraints, the PPA will not be correct until **ddcutil**'s release is incremented, i.e. until release 0.7.1

### 0.6.1

21 November 2016

The most recent release of **ddcutil** is 0.6.1.  This is a maintenance release and need not be installed
unless you are experiencing problems.  For details, see [Release Notes](release_notes.md).

### 0.6.0

01 October 2016

As of release 0.6, the name of this program changed from **ddctool** to **ddcutil** 
to avoid confusion with a commerical datacenter program also named **ddctool.**
