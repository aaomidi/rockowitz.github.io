## **libddcutil** options

Using the [configuration file](config_file.md), it is possible to pass options directly to shared library **ddcutil**. 
The option string is read and processed when **libddcutil** is initialized.
(Bear in mind that the shared library is not used by the command line program **ddcutil**.
Specifying **libddcutil** options in this context has no effect.)


Generally speaking, any **ddcutil** option, other than those for display and feature selection, can be passed to **libddcutil**. 

In addition, the following option is recognized only by **libddcutil.**: 

### Option ***--libddcutil-trace-file***

**libddcutil** crea redirect all output that would normally be sent to the terminal to a trace file instead.
Option ***--libddcutil-trace-file*** specifies the file name. The file name specified can be either absolute or relative.
If relative, the directory is resolved as per the definition of XDG_STATE_HOME in the XDG desktop specification.
Typically, this is $HOME/.local/state/ddcutil.  This allows for tracing when there is no terminal to which to write.
