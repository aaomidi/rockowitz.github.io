### Required Packages

Because of the variation among distributions, only general guidelines can be 
given for **ddctool**'s package prerequisites.  The following packages are required 
for both building and execution:

- i2c-tools
- glib-2.0  (Problem: glib-2.0 can be packaged with different names.)

At least on Ubuntu, the i2c.h header file is found in a separate package.   
If the following package exists, it is required to build ddctool.

- libi2c-dev
