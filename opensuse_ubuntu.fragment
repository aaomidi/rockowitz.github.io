Note to the curious:  There are no Ubuntu OBS packages because building ddctool requires package libi2c-dev.  Ubuntu 
puts this package in the Universe repository.  For OBS policy reasons, Universe is not availble in Ubuntu builds.
However, the Debian builds do seem to work for Ubuntu, and are an alternative to the Ubuntu PPA.
