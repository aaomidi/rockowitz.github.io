## Preliminary Notes for Release 1.0.2

Reflecting the extent of changes, development release 1.0.2 has been 
renumbered 1.1.0.  
This page previews significant changes in the release.

### Docking station connected displays

Kernel release 5.10 finally implements support for DDC communication 
over DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport.  Most commonly, this is seen with displays 
connected to docking stations.  For several years now, all docking
station connected displays, even those using HDMI or DVI connections
rely on a DisplayPort MST connection between the computer and the 
docking station. The changes are implemented in the Direct Rendering Mode (DRM)
subsytem.  The Intel i915 and AMD amdgpu drivers, which are implemented as 
part of DRM, have been tested and (mostly) work. Other drivers  part of the kernel
DRM component, e.g. nouveau should also work but have not been tested.
Nvidia's proprietary driver uses it separate implementation. 

Unfortunately there are problems with the DRM code, which ddcutil can sometimes work around.

Sometimes the display's EDID cannot be read on I2C slave port 50.  As a result, 
ddcutil does not even report the existence of a display connected to the /dev/i2c device.
**ddcutil** attempt to work around this by trying read the EDID with both 128 and 256 block
sizes. Depending on the monitor, usually one or the other will work, but sometimes neither do.  
Option ***-read-edid-size***, which was introduced in release 1.0.1, can force the block size
to 128 or 256.

Often the same monitor will appear to at two different /dev/i2c devices, only one of which 
supports DDC.  ddcutil attempts to detect which /dev/i2c device should be used for monitor
communication, and the detect command reports the other as a ***Phantom Display*** instead of an
"Invalid Display".  Thank you Laurie ... for the descriptive term.
